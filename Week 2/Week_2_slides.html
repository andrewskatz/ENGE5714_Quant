--
### Don't forget about post-class reflections

--

### The weekly writing assignments (i.e., reflections and class prep) do not need to follow the provided templates

--
### General comments about grades
* Problems sets can be revised
* My goal is for you to reach your goals. The assignments are designed with that in mind
  * If you want to modify a course assignment to a dataset you work with, we can do that!

--

### I will try to post slides before class, but we will be adding to them as we go along. The .rmd and .pdf files will be available at the course GitHub repo.

# More Week 2 Announcements

### A note about course material organization
* I do know that we could be using Canvas for organizing materials
* Tools like Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub are common in practice
* I want you all to be familiar and comfortable with these tools by the end of the semester 
* Consider this a low-stakes opportunity to learn even more new tools (yay!)

--

### A note about programming
* I certainly recognize programming may be unfamiliar to some students
* I will try to post resources (e.g., video tutorials) to help you get started
* Never hesitate to reach out to your classmates or me if you need help!
* There _are_ options we can use if programming isn't your jam

# Chapter One

### Why is My Evil Lecturer Forcing Me to Learn Statistics?


---

.center[
# Main Takeaways
]
1. Need to have an element of curiosity about what we are doing and we need data to strategically answer our questions by testing hypothesis 

2. Difference between correlation and causation and how those may get mixed up -- causation requires a much more nuanced study design

3. Data collection and consideration about what we are measuring/how we are measuring it


---

# `\(\S\)` 1.1-1.4 

### Much of this should sound familiar from last semester
* These ideas are important, especially around falsification
* We will not be discussing them too much in class
* You can consider these part of the "philosophy" track of the class

# Common Distributions

.center[
# Normal Distribution
]

.center[
In general, the notation for a normal distribution for a random variable with mean `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma\)` looks like this: &lt;br&gt;

`\(x \sim \mathcal{N} (\mu, \,\sigma^{2})\)` 
or something more specific like `\(x \sim \mathcal{N} (0, \,1)\)`

# Z-scores
]

A `\(z\)` score refers to a the score on a "standard normal" random variable. This is a random variable with `\(\mu = 0\)` and `\(\sigma = 1\)`. You would write this as: 

.center[
`\(z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)\)`
]


--

You can convert from a normal variable with mean `\(\overline{x}\)` and standard deviation `\(s\)` to a standard normal with the following equation (from p. 27):
.center[

`\(z = \frac{X - \overline{X}}{s}\)`

]


---

.center[

# Binomial distribution

]

.left[
The binomial distribution can be used to characterize a binary random variable `\(n\)` trials of probability of success `\(p\)` for each trial. &lt;br&gt;
Such a variable is denoted as: `\(x \sim \mathcal{Bin}(n, \,p)\)`

# Statistical Models

### Linear models

`\(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * X_{1i} + \beta_2*X_{2i} + \cdots + \epsilon_i\)`

--

* Here, `\(y\)` is the outcome variable, `\(X_1\)` and `\(X_2\)` are predictors, and `\(\epsilon\)` is an error term

* Note that the term "linear model" here refers to the additivity of the terms and has nothing to do with the power that the predictors are raised to.

* The following is also a linear model:
`\(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * X_{1i}^2 + \beta_2*X_{2i}^3 + \cdots + \epsilon_i\)`

** Drawing on "whiteboard" to discuss deviance and squared errors**

---
.center[
# Going Beyond the Data
]

### Standard error
* The terminology around this can be a little confusing. We will try a simulation in class to see if we can gain some intuition.
**Switch to simulation**

--

### Confidence intervals
* Be careful with the language about what confidence intervals can and cannot tell us

---

# Using Statistical Models to Test RQs
(A bit of philosophy)

1. Generate research question through initial observation
2. Generate a theory to explain your initial observation
3. Generate hypotheses - break theory into set of testable predictions
4. Collect data to test theory
5. Analyze the data - fit a statistical model


---

.center[
# Test Statistics


`\(test = \frac{\text{variance explained by model}}{\text{variance not explained by model}}\)`
]


* These test statistics can follow several common distributions such as a `\(t\)` distribution, `\(F\)` distribution, or `\(\chi^2\)` distribution

--

* From a _frequentist_ perspective, these test statistics are meaningful because they can produce `\(p\)` values

--

* A `\(p\)` value tells you the probability of seeing a test statistic as extreme or more extreme under the null hypothesis


---

.center[
# Statistical Significance vs Practical Significance
]

---
.center[
# Type I and Type II Errors
]

--

* Type I error is also known as a false positive
--

* Type I error involves finding a significant result when there actually is not
--

* `\(\alpha\)`-level refers to type I errors and is usually set at 0.05 (or 5%)

--

* Type II error is also known as a false negative
--

* Type II error involves _not_ finding a significant result when there acutally _is_
--

* `\(\beta\)`-level refers to type II errors and is usually set at 0.8 (or 80%)


---

.center[
# Statistical Power
]

---

# Work through example

* Identify a research question

* Identify how to collect data

* What are our hypotheses?

* What does statistical signifance mean here?

* What does practical significance mean here?
