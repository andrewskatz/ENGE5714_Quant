# Week 2 Announcements

]

--
### Don't forget about post-class reflections

--

### The weekly writing assignments (i.e., reflections and class prep) do not need to follow the provided templates

--
### General comments about grades
* Problems sets can be revised
* My goal is for you to reach your goals. The assignments are designed with that in mind
  * If you want to modify a course assignment to a dataset you work with, we can do that!

--

### I will try to post slides before class, but we will be adding to them as we go along. The .rmd and .pdf files will be available at the course GitHub repo.

# More Week 2 Announcements

### A note about course material organization
* I do know that we could be using Canvas for organizing materials
* Tools like Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub are common in practice
* I want you all to be familiar and comfortable with these tools by the end of the semester 
* Consider this a low-stakes opportunity to learn even more new tools (yay!)

--

### A note about programming
* I certainly recognize programming may be unfamiliar to some students
* I will try to post resources (e.g., video tutorials) to help you get started
* Never hesitate to reach out to your classmates or me if you need help!
* There _are_ options we can use if programming isn't your jam

# Today's Plan

### Refresh of some ideas from Fall research methods

### 

---

# Reviewing Prior Knowledge (1/4)

### Q: When we think about research - _building knowledge_ - when and how do quantitative methods fit in?



---


# Reviewing Prior Knowledge (2/4)

### Q: What worldviews or paradigms are generally associated with quantitative methods?




---


# Reviewing Prior Knowledge (3/4)

### Q: What research quality words do we generally associate with quantitative methods?



---


# Reviewing Prior Knowledge (4/4)

### Q: What study designs do we generally associated with quantitative methods?

# $\S$ 1.1-1.4 

### Much of this should sound familiar from last semester
* These ideas are important, especially around falsification
* We will not be discussing them too much in class
* You can consider these part of the "philosophy" track of the class

# Common Distributions

# Normal Distribution
]

.center[
In general, the notation for a normal distribution for a random variable with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ looks like this: <br>

$x \sim \mathcal{N} (\mu, \,\sigma^{2})$ 
or something more specific like $x \sim \mathcal{N} (0, \,1)$

```{r normal-hist, echo = FALSE}
x <- rnorm(n = 10000, sd = 1, mean = 0)

hist(x)


```
]

--

.pull-right[

```{r normal-geom_histogram}

x_df <- as_tibble(x)
ggplot(data = x_df, mapping = aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram()


```

# Binomial distribution

.left[The binomial distribution can be used to characterize a binary random variable $n$ trials of probability of success $p$ for each trial. <br>
Such a variable is denoted as: $x \sim \mathcal{Bin}(n, \,p)$
