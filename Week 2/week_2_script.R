## Week 2 Notes

## One of the first things you will have in any script or .rmd file is a section to load
## all the libraries that you use in that script.

# you can install a library by using the install.packages() function, for example:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# with this installed, you can then load the package using the library() function


library(tidyverse)
