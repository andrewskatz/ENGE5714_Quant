# Today's Plan

--

### _Brief_ Intro to Cluster Analysis

--

#### Review basics of clustering

--

#### Two identification exercises

--

#### R Demo(s)

--

### Reviewing and Reporting Quant Studies

---

# Today's Goals

--

* Understand basic goal of clustering

--

* Understand how k-means clustering functions

--

* Understand how hierarchical clustering functions

--

* Identify where clustering might be used _in general eng. ed. settings_

--

* Identify where clustering might be used _in your own work_

--

* Implement clustering in R

---

class: center, inverse, middle

# Cluster Analysis


---

# What is the point?

--

* Grouping data points that are similar

--

* Data reduction for observations (as opposed to reduction of variables - that's factor analysis)

---

# Types of clustering

* Centroid vs density-based

* Flat vs hierarchical


---

# Step 1

--

## Feature selection

---

# Step 2

## Compute similarities

* Euclidean distance
--

* Manhattan distance

--

* Pearson correlation distance

--

### This produces a distance matrix

---

# Step 3

## Perform the actual clustering


---

# Design Choices

* Type of clustering algorithm
  * K-means
  * Gaussian mixture model
  * DBSCAN
  * Hierarchical
  * Ward
  * HDBSCAN

* Type of clustering rule
  * Single linkage
  * Complete linkage
  * Average linkage
