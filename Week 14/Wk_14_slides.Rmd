### Great work on problem set 3

--

### Problem Set 4 due 4/22

--

### I have assigned week 1 (4/27) and week 2 (5/04) for projects

* Week 1 - Amy, Andrea, Alli, Rene, Sidd, Yasir

* Week 2 - Abe, Isil, Jeremy, Matt, Maya, Melissa, and Taylor


--

### Don't forget about the feedback surveys

# Today's Plan

--

### Causal Inference

--

#### Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling

--

#### Hierarchical (aka Multilevel) Modeling

--

#### Missing Data

--

### Bayesian Data Analysis


---

---

class: center, inverse, middle

# Causal Inference


---

# What do we know about causal inference?

(i.e., what does "Causation" even mean?)

--


---

# Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference


---

# As Aside About Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs)

* Notation
  * Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
  * Undirected graphs
  * Factor graphs (do not confuse with factor analysis)

---

# PGMs - 2

* 


---

# Common Approaches to Causal Inference

* Randomized Control Trials

---

# Commons Approaches to Causal Inference - 2

* Difference-in-differences


---

# Common Approaches to Causal Inference - 3

* Instrumental Variables



---

# Common Approaches to Causal Inference - 4

* Regression Discontinuity


---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Factor Analysis

---

# What is the problem?

* We want to measure latent traits

* We want to measure relationships between latent traits

---
# How does Factor Analysis work?

* 


---
class: inverse, middle, center

# Hierarchical Models

---
# What is the problem?

* The i.i.d. assumption

* Might want to make one model or several individual models

---

# How does HLM/MLM work?

* Account for nesting in the data


---

# Where might this come up?

* Students nested in classrooms

* Classrooms nested in universities

* Employees nested in companies


---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Missing Data

---

# What is the problem?

* Data _might_ be systematically missing

---

# Kinds of missing data

* Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)

* Missing at Random (MAR)

* Missing Not at Random (MNAR or NMAR)

---

# MCAR


---

# MAR


---

# NMAR

$S=frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i}{n}\;\middle|\;X_i\sim\chi^2(k)$


---
class: center, inverse, middle

Bayesian Inference

---

# What is the problem?

* Point estimates

* Assumptions behind p values and hypothesis testing

---

# Bayes Theorem

$Pr(A|B)=\frac{\Pr(B|A)\Pr(A)}{\Pr(B|A)\Pr(A)+\Pr(B|\neg A)\Pr(\neg A)}$


---

$P(D\mid M) = \frac{P(D) * P(M\mid D)}{P(M)}$

$P(D) = \sum_MP(M,D)$

---

# Step 1

--

## Feature selection

---

# Step 2

## Compute similarities

* Euclidean distance

--

* Manhattan distance

--

* Cosine distance

--

### This produces a distance matrix

_(Primarily useful for hierarchical methods)_

---

# Step 3

## Perform the actual clustering


---

# Design Choices

.pull-left[
* Type of clustering algorithm
  * K-means
  * Gaussian mixture model
  * DBSCAN
  * Hierarchical
  * Ward
  * HDBSCAN
]

.pull-right[
* Type of clustering rule
  * Single linkage
  * Complete linkage
  * Average linkage
]
