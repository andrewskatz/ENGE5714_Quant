## Another Worked Example ----

# This script takes an incomplete subset of senior data from a .csv file, cleans it, 
# computes factor scores, and prepares it for analysis.


# Additionally, this script is being used to teach and so occasionally blocks of code 
# will be included but commented out in order to demonstrate in class 
# how to explore and analyze the data

library(tidyverse)
library(psych)

# load file seniorsurvey.csv into R
file_path <- "YOUR PATH HERE" 
setwd(file_path) # use this command to change the working directory to the folder where you have your file
list.files() # run this to make sure that your file is in your current working directory



seniorSurvey_df <- read_csv("./data/seniorsurvey.csv") # replace text in the parentheses with your file name


# After loading, it is always nice to just see how things loaded in.
# Functions like str() and describe() from the psych package are nice for this.
# For example, if we use describe(), we can see the following (we deleted some variables):
psych::describe(seniorSurvey_df)

# Upon examining this, I notice a few things:
#	Primary Major variable is all messed up.  I won't fix it in this script, but basically there is a numeric code needed (e.g., 13 = underwater basket weaving)
#	Columns 3 and 5 have lots of missing values (note the small N's) -- this means that this was asked via checkbox so (1) is true and missing is not missing but False
#	SJ1-8 and DA1-5 all look essentially ok -- about the same N (some survey fatigue or skips) but all values in range (1-5)

# Now, we know that SJ and DA are scales from the literature and we want to compute scale scores for those.  Typically for attitude scales like these
# we just report means across the items.  So, we will use the "psych" package to use a built in function to help us with this.  If you have not used psych
# yet, be sure it is installed using the command install.packages("psych") -- you need only do this once and then in subsequent uses you only need
# require(psych) to tell R to look in that package for the functions you will be using.

library(psych)

# subset out only the SJ and DA items in their own dataframe and then use tools in the psych package to compute scale means

# mMthod one to do this - use numbering of the columns
seniorSurveyScales_df <- seniorSurvey_df[6:18]

# Method two to do this - use select() from dplyr

seniorSurveyScales_df <- seniorSurvey_df %>% select(SJ1:DA5)


# use make.keys() function from psych package to key-in how the scales are built (mapping items to scales, use - for reverse scored items)
my_keys <- make.keys(seniorSurveyScales_df, list(SJCa=c(-1,-2,-3,-4),SJCh=c(5,6,7),DA=c(-9,-10,-11,12,13)))

# use scoreItems function to score each respondent on the three scales of interest SJCa, SJCh, and DA -- the default here in scoreItems is to
# takes the mean of the items (not additive though that is sometimes used) and also, it imputes missing values instead of dropping cases 
# the scoreItems function calculates many things.  At this stage, all we really want are the scores, so I include a line to only extract that info
my_scales <- scoreItems(my_keys, seniorSurveyScales_df)	
my_scores <- my_scales$scores

# now, if you view the first few rows of the my.scores vector using the header -- head() command -- it looks like we expect:
#  head(my.scores)
#     SJCa     SJCh  DA
# [1,] 2.75 3.000000 3.2
# [2,] 3.75 3.333333 4.2
# [3,] 3.00 3.000000 3.0
# [4,] 2.25 4.333333 3.6
# [5,] 3.00 3.333333 3.4
# [6,] 4.50 4.333333 3.4

# now, lets build a clean dataframe to prep for analysis - by clean in this case I mean that we have replaced item scores from the scales with
# their means and also that we have fixed the NAs that don't belong (for participation variables, in this dataset, the NAs should be 0s)
my_df <- tibble(seniorSurvey.df[1:5],my_scores, seniorSurvey.df[19:25])


# old school method to replace NAs in specific columns
my_df$ParticipateServiceL[is.na(mydf$ParticipateServiceL)] <- 0 
my_df$ParticipateCService[is.na(mydf$ParticipateCService)] <- 0 
my_df$ParticipateStudyAbroadSemester[is.na(mydf$ParticipateStudyAbroadSemester)] <- 0 
# mydf$ParticipateInternCoop...[is.na(mydf$ParticipateInternCoop...)] <- 0 ------- this variable read in cumbersomely named and I don't care about it right now so I'll skip


# alternative method to replace NAs in specific columns
my_df <- tidyr::replace_na(my_df, list(ParticipateCService = 0, ParticipateStudyAbroadSemester = 0, ParticipateServiceL = 0))




# At this point, I'm primed to do some analysis

# Let's investigate correlations
# What seems most obvious would just be to run cor() but, as we found out in class,
# this can cause us to run full speed ahead without considering assumptions
my_correlations <- my_df %>% select(SJCa,SJCh,DA) %>% cor()
print(my_correlations)

# Ok, so, it is important that we note that this ran correlations but R doesn't
# know that this was sample data and therefore that we are interested in 
# statistical significance (or not) of these results AND that our data may need
# another method (e.g., non-parametric).  cor() does have a way to run spearman
# instead
my_spearman_correlations <- my_df %>% select(SJCa,SJCh,DA) %>% cor(method="spearman")
print(my_spearman_correlations)

# If we need p values though, we need to change to something else -- corr.test

my_results <- corr_test(my_df$SJCa,my_df$DA)

# and then I can pull out results from this list or print it.  I'll do both 
print(my_results,short=FALSE)
my_results$r # correlation coefficient
my_results$p # p-value

# visually, we should be able to see this on a scatterplot.  I'm going to use qplot
# which stands for quickplot from within ggplot.  It is useful and quicker for simple
# plotting than building up ggplot (though from the same package)
# i need to jitter my points (take geom="jitter" out if you want to see why)
qplot(SJCa,DA,data=my_df,geom="jitter")

qqnorm(my_df$SJCa, frame = FALSE)
qqline(my_df$SJCa, col = "steelblue", lwd = 1.5)

my_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = SJCa)) +
  geom_histogram()


# other functions we used today in class were describe() and also the q-q plot creation
# to investigate normality assumption copying syntax from the Field, Miles, & Field book
