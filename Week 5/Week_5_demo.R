### data generation demo - one set sample size ##########


#store the sample size that we want to use
samp_size <- 100

# uniformly sample X values (values for our predictor variable) from 0 to 20 
x <- round(runif(n = samp_size, min = 0, max = 30), digits = 1) # this gives samp_size number of random numbers



# store the noise values for our different test models
sd_min <- 2 # low noise
sd_med <- 6 # medium noise
sd_max <- 12 # high noise


# generate the outcome variable values under different amounts of noise (the rnorm() function is what is generating noise here)
y_noise_sd_none <- 3 + 2*x # this is the true relationship without any noise
y_noise_sd_min <- 3 + 2*x + round(x = rnorm(n = samp_size, mean = 0, sd = sd_min), digits = 1)
y_noise_sd_med <- 3 + 2*x + round(x = rnorm(n = samp_size, mean = 0, sd = sd_med), digits = 1)
y_noise_sd_max <- 3 + 2*x + round(x = rnorm(n = samp_size, mean = 0, sd = sd_max), digits = 1)



# typical step 1: visualize! Let's plot each of these x values vs y
plot(x, y_noise_sd_none)
plot(x, y_noise_sd_min)
plot(x, y_noise_sd_med)
plot(x, y_noise_sd_max)


# let's put all of these vectors together into a data frame to make it easier to analyze later on
# note, this is not a vital step for conducting the simple regression
demo_df <- tibble("x" = x, 
                  "y_noise_sd_none"=y_noise_sd_none, 
                  "y_noise_sd_min" = y_noise_sd_min,
                  "y_noise_sd_med" = y_noise_sd_med,
                  "y_noise_sd_max" = y_noise_sd_max)

#check out what demo_df looks like
head(demo_df)

# order by increasing x value
demo_df <- demo_df %>% 
  arrange(x)

# check out what the arrange() function did
head(demo_df)

# let's make this a long df so that we can plot multiple standard deviation values together
demo_df_long <- demo_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("y_noise"),
               names_to = "y_col",
               values_to = "y_val"
  )

# again, check on what this did
head(demo_df_long)

# let's add in a column to note whether the value is from the min, med, max, or zero sd (noise) model
demo_df_long <- demo_df_long %>% 
  mutate(sd_val = case_when(str_detect(y_col, "sd_none") ~ 0,
                            str_detect(y_col, "sd_min") ~ sd_min,
                            str_detect(y_col, "sd_med") ~ sd_med,
                            str_detect(y_col, "sd_max") ~ sd_max))

# use facet_grid to separate the plots out by 
demo_df_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y_val)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(.~y_col)

# you can also automatically add in a line with the geom_smooth() function
demo_df_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y_val)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  facet_grid(.~y_col)



# now we can create a linear model for the data with minimum noise with the following command:
fit_demo_min <- lm(y_noise_sd_min ~ x)

# and we can look at the summary of the model with:
summary(fit_demo_min)

# we can also look at model results with the glance() function from the broom package
broom::glance(fit_demo_min)


# we can create models for the med and max sd values as well and take a look at those with the summary() function once again
fit_demo_med <- lm(y_noise_sd_med ~ x)
summary(fit_demo_med)

fit_demo_max <- lm(y_noise_sd_max ~ x)
summary(fit_demo_max)

# notice the increase in the standard error of the coefficient estimates as the noise in y values went up



# from a programming perspective, this was not very efficient because I just copied, pasted, and corrected these values.
# there is a better way to do this using lists (see below)



# let's do some fancy stuff to make multiple models at once rather than having to write new lines for each model
# some of these ideas are taken from the R4DS book chapter 25
test_nest <- demo_df_long %>% nest(data = -sd_val)

summary(models[[3]])
summary(models[[4]])


# we can also store the models as new columns in the nested dataframe

### data generation demo - one set sample size; 
## The change from the past demo is that we are now sampling from integer values rather than continuous for the predictor #######



#store the sample size that we want to use
samp_size <- 200


# instead of sampling uniformly from 0 to 20, this is to sample integers from 40 to 100 uniformly.
# we take "samp_size" number of samples. Replace = TRUE means we can get the same x value multiple times
x <- sample(x = c(60:100), size = samp_size, replace = TRUE)

# as before, store the noise values for our different test models
