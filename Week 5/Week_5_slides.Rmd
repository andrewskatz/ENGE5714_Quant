# Introduction to Regression

--

* We will start with simple regression this week

--

* Simple regression involves one predictor and one outcome

--

* Next week we move to multiple regression





---

# General Modeling Philosophy

--

The general approach is to model the outcome variable as a function of some predictor(s) plus an error term. Mathematically, this looks like:

.center[
$outcome_i = model + error_i$
]

where the $i$ subscript refers to the $i^{th}$ person in the sample. 



---

# The Simple Regression Model

--

In simple regression, the model looks like:

.center[
$Y_i = (b_0 + b_1 * X_i) + \epsilon_i$

]

--

* The $Y_i$ is the value of the outcome variable for person $i$

--

* $b_0$ and $b_1$ are the regression coefficients

  * These are the things we are trying to find
  
  * They are the same for each person

--
  
* The $X_i$ is the values of the predictor variable for person $i$

--

* The $\epsilon_i$ is the error term for person $i$

  * This accounts for the discrepancy between what the model predicts person $i$'s outcome variable will be and what it _actually_ is observed to be

---

# Finding Coefficient Values

-- 

* To find coefficient values, we use the method of least squares

-- 

* The basic philosophy is to find values for $b_0$ and $b_1$
