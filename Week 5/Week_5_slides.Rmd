# Introduction to Regression

--

* We will start with simple regression this week

--

* **Simple regression involves one predictor and one outcome**

--

* Next week we move to multiple regression





---

# General Modeling Philosophy

--

The general approach for the next several weeks is to model the outcome variable as a function of some predictor(s) plus an error term. 

--

Mathematically, this looks like:

.center[
$outcome_i = model + error_i$
]

where the $i$ subscript refers to the $i^{th}$ person in the sample. 



---

# The Simple Regression Model

--

In simple regression, the model looks like:

.center[
$Y_i = (b_0 + b_1 * X_i) + \epsilon_i$

]

--

* The $Y_i$ is the value of the outcome variable for person $i$

--

* $b_0$ and $b_1$ are the regression coefficients

  * These are the things we are trying to find
  
  * They are the same for each person

--
  
* The $X_i$ is the values of the predictor variable for person $i$

--

* The $\epsilon_i$ is the error term for person $i$

  * This accounts for the discrepancy between what the model predicts person $i$'s outcome variable will be and what it _actually_ is observed to be



---

# Finding Coefficient Values

--

* To find coefficient values, we use the method of least squares

--

* The basic philosophy is to find values for $b_0$ and $b_1$ that minimize the distance between the actual observed outcome, $y_i$, and the estimated outcome, $\hat{y}_i$

--

* As a reminder, $\hat{y}_i$ is calculated as:  $\hat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1*X_i$ 

--

* In a _frequestist_ paradigm this is done using maximum likelihood estimation
  * The math for this is beyond the scope of this class

--

* Practically speaking, we use this kind of syntax in R: 
.center[
`lm(outcome ~ predictor, data = your_data)`
]


---

# Interpreting Coefficient Values

.pull-left[

* The intercept $b_0$ is the value of the outcome when the value of the predictor is 0

* A common strategy is to first center the $x_i$ values by subtracting $\overline{x}$ from each $x_i$

* If you center your variables first, then the interpretation of $b_0$ is the value of the outcome at an average value of the predictor

]

--

.pull-right[

* The slope $b_1$ is the change in the outcome variable for a 1-unit change in the predictor variable

]


---

# What Makes a Good Model?

--

* Short answer: Small sum of squares. Specifically, we want to minimize the squared distance between $y_i$ and $\hat{y}_i$

--

* In the book this is noted as $deviation = \sum_{i=1}^{N}(observed_i - estimated_i)^2$

--

* Longer answer: Think about three kinds of sums of squares:

  1. Sum of squares total $SS_T$
  2. Sum of squares residual $SS_R$
  3. Sum of square model $SS_M$

--

* We are interested in reducing $SS_R$




---
# Good Models (cont.)

* Another way of saying this: we want to explain as much of the variation in the data as possible

--

* The total variation is $SS_T$

--

* The model variation is $SS_M$

--

* If $SS_T$ and $SS_M$ are close to each other, then their ratio is close to 1

--

* This is how we calculate $R^2$:
.center[
$R^2 = \frac{SS_M}{SS_T}$
]


--

* Note that $SS_T = SS_M + SS_R$, which is a fancy way of saying the total variance can be decomposed into explained + unexplained variance (where "explained" variance refers to the variance explained by the model)

--

* If we take the _mean sum of squares_, we get $MS_R$ and $MS_M$, which are used to calculate the F statistic:

.center[
$F = \frac{MS_R}{MS_M}$
]




---

# Interpreting measures of fit

--

* A higher $R^2$ value corresponds to a better fit

--

* Look at the equation for $R^2$:

.center[
$R^2 = \frac{SS_M}{SS_T} = \frac{SS_T - SS_R}{SS_T} = 1 - \frac{SS_R}{SS_T}$
]

--

* Takeaway: a smaller residual sum of squares corresponds to a higher $R^2$ value


---

# Assessing Invidiaul Predictors in a Model

--

* The null model in regression is for each predictor to equal 0

--

* Our hypothesis testing is testing against this null hypothesis that $b_1 = 0$

--

* This means the alternative hypothesis is $b_1 \neq 0$

--

* We test whether we have good reason to reject the null hypothesis that $b_1 = 0$ by calculating the t-statistic:
.center[
$t = \frac{b_{1, model} - b_{1, null}}{SE_{b_1}}$
]

--

* This simplifies to 
.center[
$t = \frac{b_{1, model}}{SE_{b_1}}$
]
