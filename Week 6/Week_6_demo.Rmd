### Explore the child aggression data set #########

```{r}

ca_df <- read.table("./data/ChildAggression.dat", header = TRUE)

```

Method 1 for quickly getting summary statistics for the data you have, using the built-in summary() function


```{r}
summary(ca_df)
```

Method 2, using the describe() function from the psych package

```{r}
psych::describe(ca_df)
```

Spot check: where do the "se" values come from?


# now that we have seen some of the numbers, let's try to visualize some of these data
# let's try to visualize the data while we're at it


```{r}

ca_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Aggression)) +
  geom_histogram()


```


We could do this for each of our variables or we could try something a little fancier by using the pivot_longer() function to make a longer dataframe and plot everything at once


First, create the long dataframe. After running this command, it's a good idea to view the new data frame to make sure this did what you intended


```{r}
ca_df_long <- ca_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = Aggression:Parenting_Style, names_to = "variable_name", values_to = "variable_value")

```

After making sure everything looks in order, run the same plot command with the addition of a facet.

Note that the fill = variable_name tells R to color the plot with different colors by variable_name and the theme(...) tells R to get rid of the legend that automatically shows up


```{r}

ca_df_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = variable_value, fill = variable_name)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(variable_name ~.) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


From this we should be able to see that everything is normally distributed and appears to be standardized

Let's try a different kind of visualization: the empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) (sounds fancy, but it's not bad)

```{r}

ca_df_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = variable_value)) +
  stat_ecdf(geom = "point") +
  facet_wrap(variable_name ~.) 


```

It looks like a bunch of distorted s shapes. In order to understand what is going on here, we should take a brief detour into the world of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), eCDFs, and eventually QQ plots. This detour is at the end of the markdown file. 








Now we can try a third way of visualizing our data - QQ plots!

As before, we can plot each variable with separate calls or plot them all together with the long data frame

```{r}

ca_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample=Aggression)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line()


```


```{r}

ca_df_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample=variable_value)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line() +
  facet_wrap(variable_name ~ .)


```



## Multiple regression


Let's create a model of child aggression as a function of parenting style and sibling aggression
```{r}
model_fam <- lm(Aggression ~ Parenting_Style + Sibling_Aggression, data = ca_df)
```

Run the summary on the model
```{r}
summary(model_fam)
```


This will be helpful later when we want to plot the residuals of the model.


Let's create another model of child aggression as a function of computer games and television.

```{r}
model_screens <- lm(Aggression ~ Computer_Games + Television, data = ca_df)

summary(model_screens)
```

Now let's see what the full model looks like with all five predictors
```{r}
model_all <- lm(Aggression ~ Parenting_Style + Sibling_Aggression + Diet + Computer_Games + Television, 
                data = ca_df)
summary(model_all)
```

We can get the output from the summary() function but as a tibble instead:
```{r}
broom::tidy(model_all, conf.int = TRUE)
```

We can also get summary statistics like the R^2, F-statistics, and AIC from the glance() function in the Broom package
```{r}
broom::glance(model_all)
```

Let's stop here to interpret what the model output is telling us(specifically, the coefficient estimates, the standard errors, the p values, and the R^2 values).

Notice the Television p value and standard errors (especially how the estimate is so close to zero, and its 95% confidence interval crosses 0)




We can also have R handle factors automatically in a regression model for us.

First, we will generate a new factor for the child aggression data - the handedness of the child (left vs right).

This code generates a random handedness for each of the 666 students and assigns it to a new column in ca_df

```{r}
handed_levels <- c("left", "right")
handed_vector <- sample(handed_levels, size = nrow(ca_df), replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.4, 0.6))
ca_df$Handedness <- handed_vector
```

Check to make sure we have all the predictor names correct to add into the linear model.

```{r}
names(ca_df)
model_all_3 <- lm(Aggression ~ Parenting_Style + Sibling_Aggression + Television + Computer_Games + Diet + Handedness, data = ca_df)
```

Check the model summary and notice how the Handedness predictor variable was handled.
 
```{r}
summary(model_all_3)

lm(Aggression ~ ., data=ca_df)
```





### Assumption testing

Note: A lot of the things we are doing here can be accomplished with the augment() function in the broom package

Check for correlation between adjacent residual terms using Durbin-Watson test 

```{r}

dwt(model_all)

```
Check for multicollinearity.
```{r}

car::vif(model_all)

```



Now let's go back and check for influential cases following the procedure Field does in the textbook.

```{r}
ca_df$residuals <- resid(model_all) # notice how this is the same as looking at View(model_all) and then residuals or model_all$residuals
#model_all$residuals
ca_df$standardized.residuals <- rstandard(model_all)
ca_df$studentized.residuals <- rstudent(model_all)
ca_df$cooks.distance <- cooks.distance(model_all)
ca_df$dfbeta <- dfbeta(model_all)
ca_df$dffit <- dffits(model_all)
ca_df$leverage <- hatvalues(model_all)
ca_df$covariance.ratios <- covratio(model_all)
```

Now that we have all of the extra model fit statistics calculated, we can add a new olumn using a different method than what he does in the textbook (but this accomplishes the same task).

We are using a combination of mutate() and case_when() instead of the traditional logical test subsetting that we see in the bookon pp. 289-290

```{r}
ca_df <- ca_df %>% 
  mutate(large.residual = case_when(standardized.residuals > 2 | standardized.residuals < -2 ~ TRUE,
                                    abs(standardized.residuals) <= 2 ~ FALSE))
```

Now let's just look at the observations where there was a large residual (absolute value > 2)

```{r}
ca_df %>% filter(large.residual == TRUE) %>% head()

```

There's a problem here because we don't preserve observation numbers. In general, it might be a good idea to give each observation an ID with something like

```{r}
dim(ca_df)[1]
```

```{r}
ca_df <- ca_df %>% 
  mutate(ID = seq(1:dim(ca_df)[1]))
```

In the tidyverse, there is an even simpler way to do this with the rowid_to_column() function!

```{r}
ca_df <- ca_df %>% 
  rowid_to_column(var = "participant_id")
```

Now we can run the filter again and see which observations have large residuals

```{r}
ca_df %>% filter(large.residual == TRUE) %>% view()
```




Plot the residuals against the fitted values
```{r}
ca_df$fitted <- model_all$fitted.values

```

First, plot the distribution of the residuals by themselves

```{r}
histogram <- ca_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = studentized.residuals)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) +
  labs(x = "Studentized Residuals",
       y = "Density")
histogram
```

Now let's add a normal density on top of that for comparison

```{r}
histogram + stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                          args = list(mean = mean(ca_df$studentized.residuals, na.rm = TRUE), 
                                      sd = sd(ca_df$studentized.residuals, na.rm = TRUE)), 
                          color = "blue", size = 1)
```

Second, plot the residuals against the fitted values to make sure there are no systematic patterns

```{r}
ca_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fitted, y = studentized.residuals)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Fitted Residual",
       y = "Studentized Residual")
```

We can also skip all the fancy code from the book and use the plot() function on the model.

R knows that this means we want to plot four fit plots

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # this changes the arrangement for the plots to show two rows and two columns of plots
```


```{r}
plot(model_all)
par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # this changes the plotting arrangement back to the default of one plot at a time
```

Note that we could also create a model that uses all our covariates as predictors with the following call

```{r}
model_all_2 <- lm(Aggression ~ ., data=ca_df)
```

Inspect the results to make sure it is giving the same results as before

```{r}
plot(model_all_2)
summary(model_all_2)
```




Check how augment() works and which parts of the above it replicates

```{r}
augmented_model_all <- augment(model_all)
```


```{r}
ca_df_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = variable_value, fill = variable_name)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", alpha = 0.5)
```












### Detour: Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), empirical CDF, and QQ Plot Discussion

Our goal here is to visualize the cumulative distribution function for a normal distribution as a stepping stone toward undestanding QQ plots. We will use plots of the empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF)


As a way to visualize our data. Although we have not discussed eCDFs before, they are another tool you can use to visualize the distribution of quantitative data.

We will also look at the effect of sample size on the kinds of plots that we may make when visualizing the distribution of data. 


First, let's generate some data to help us see what these concepts are all about. 

**Note** that We are generating data to make things easier on ourselves - we know the underlying data-generating process. So that lets us form an expectation of what *should* happen. These kinds of toy examples can be helpful for building an intuition about these concepts that we can then use in our own work.

```{r}
df_1 <- tibble(x = round(rnorm(n = 25, mean = 0, sd = 1), digits = 1), samp_size = rep(x = 25, times = 25))
df_2 <- tibble(x = round(rnorm(n = 50, mean = 0, sd = 1), digits = 1), samp_size = rep(x = 50, times = 50))
df_3 <- tibble(x = round(rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1), digits = 1), samp_size = rep(x = 100, times = 100))
df_4 <- tibble(x = round(rnorm(n = 200, mean = 0, sd = 1), digits = 1), samp_size = rep(x = 200, times = 200))
df_5 <- tibble(x = round(rnorm(n = 500, mean = 0, sd = 1), digits = 1), samp_size = rep(x = 500, times = 500))

```

Combine the generated data together into one data frame to make it easy to plot everything in one ggplot call.


```{r}

sample_df <- bind_rows(df_1, df_2, df_3, df_4, df_5)


```


Look at the empirical CDFs


```{r}

sample_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x)) +
  stat_ecdf(geom = "point") +
  facet_grid(samp_size~.)


```

```{r}

sample_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(samp_size~.)


```



In class, this should lead to a discussion about how to find quantiles now let's try to look at some QQ plots. 

```{r}
df_1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample=x)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line()
```

Let's try to wrap our heads around what is going on by looking at sorted versions of df_1 values


```{r}

head(df_1 %>% arrange(x))

```

Let's also look at the other end of the dataframe. We can do this either using arrange(desc(x)) or tail instead of head
Confirm that they're basically two ways of accomplishing the same objective.


```{r}

head(df_1 %>% arrange(desc(x)))
tail(df_1 %>% arrange(x))


```


End detour



### Generating data for student happiness exercise.

We are going to student happiness scores on a scale from 0 to 100 as a function of their time spent outdoors, time spent on Zoom, class standing, and department. 


```{r}

pop_size <- 5000
sample_size <- 200


pop_df <- tibble(standing = rep(c("undergrad", "masters", "phd"), 
                 times = c(pop_size/2, pop_size/4, pop_size/4)))

pop_df$discipline <- rep(c("mechanical", "civil", "electrical"), 
                         length.out = pop_size)

pop_df$min_outdoors <- round(runif(n = pop_size, min = 0, max = 300), 0)

pop_df$min_zoom <- round(runif(n = pop_size, min = 0, max = 400), 0)

pop_df <- pop_df %>% 
  mutate(undergrad = case_when(standing == "undergrad" ~ 1,
                           TRUE ~ 0),
         masters = case_when(standing == "masters" ~ 1,
                           TRUE ~ 0),
         phd = case_when(standing == "phd" ~ 1,
                           TRUE ~ 0),
         civil = case_when(discipline == "civil" ~ 1,
                           TRUE ~ 0),
         mechanical = case_when(discipline == "mechanical" ~ 1,
                           TRUE ~ 0),
         electrical = case_when(discipline == "electrical" ~ 1,
                           TRUE ~ 0))

```

With the predictors generated, we can now generate the happiness scores. 
```{r}
#pop_df <- pop_df %>% 
#  mutate(happiness = 50 + -.2*(min_zoom+runif(n = 1, min = 10, max = 30)) + .1 * min_outdoors + 4*civil -.3 * mechanical)

b_0 <- 50
b_out <- 0.03
b_zoom <- -0.05
b_civ <- 6
b_mech <- 2
b_ele <- -3
b_under <- 5
b_masters <- -2
b_phd <- 10

pop_df$happiness <- b_0 + b_out*(pop_df$min_outdoors + rnorm(pop_size, 0, 40)) +
  b_zoom*(pop_df$min_zoom + rnorm(pop_size, 0, 40)) + 
  b_civ*(pop_df$civil + rnorm(pop_size, 0, 2)) + 
  b_mech*pop_df$mechanical +
  b_ele*pop_df$electrical + b_under * pop_df$undergrad + 
  b_masters*pop_df$masters +
  b_phd*pop_df$phd + round(rnorm(n = pop_size, mean = 0, sd = 10), 0)


```

We will save the full population dataset. That is what we will start with in class

```{r}

pop_df %>% write_csv("./data/student_happiness.csv")

```

Now we create a sample of students by sampling from the population dataframe.

```{r}

samp_df <- sample_n(pop_df, size = 200)

```




On the modeling side, we can first start with a very simple model with only one predictor.

```{r}

happiness_zoom <- lm(happiness ~ min_zoom, data = samp_df)
summary(happiness_zoom)

```

Next, we can look at what happens with a more complex model with multiple predictors. Pay attention to how the $R^2$ value changes.

```{r}

happiness_all <- lm(happiness ~ min_outdoors + min_zoom + civil + mechanical + electrical + undergrad + masters + phd, data = samp_df)
summary(happiness_all)

```

An alternative way of writing the full model

```{r}
happiness_all <- lm(happiness ~ min_outdoors + min_zoom + discipline + standing, data = samp_df)
summary(happiness_all)


```
